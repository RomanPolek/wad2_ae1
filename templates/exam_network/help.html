        <p class="text">There's a few steps to this part. <br /> First, click Add Exam in the navigation bar. <br /> Next, select the course you're writing the exam for from the dropdown menu, like you did when adding your students. <br />Now, give your exam a Title by typing it in text box. <br />Now you need to set the time students will be able to sit the exam.

Do the same for the deadline<br />Now you click the blue button with the "+" symbol to start adding questions. <br>Type the question itself in the content box and give one of five potential answers in the answer box. Make sure to click the round button next to the correct answer. <br />Repeat that for as many questions as you'd like to add. <br />Finally, if you're happy with what you've got click the blue "Add" button at the bottom and you're done!<br />If you change your mind at any point you can click the grey "Cancel" button to clear everything out and start again.</p>
